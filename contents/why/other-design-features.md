## Other Design Features

The current system is absolutely trustless. That means that there is no central authority verifying anything (such as all BOINC based coins, which rely on an external service controlled by a single entity and which could become rogue and cripple the entire coin), so we at Elastic have to make sure every node in the network verifies work by itself. To further act as a safeguard, Super Nodes check work processed by the nodes and a final level of security is in the Guard Nodes that check that the SuperNodes are doing their job.

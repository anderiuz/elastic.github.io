Emergence of Ethereum Classic created a huge opportunity for miners. ETC is presently one of the [most profitable](http://whattomine.com/) tokens to mine and is attracting substantial hash power with zero switching cost.

As a miner, it's in your best interests to support ETC. Ethereum Foundation is going to "fire" all Ethereum miners by switching to experimental PoS model. Ethereum Classic is going to maintain time-proven PoW consensus, rewarding GPU miners supporting the original Ethereum chain. Do it for profit *and* principles; mine Ethereum Classic today!

In June 2017, weâ€™ll be launching a lite wallet for Elastic. This will not be a fully functioning wallet, but will only be used for redeeming XEL by original donators and sending and receiving XEL.

**This has been done for the following reasons:**

- To allow XEL to be traded.
- To provide devs, testers, UX and PR people to become involved in the project by being able to buy XEL and have a financial stake in it.
- To create funds to set up a foundation to pay for the work done on Elastic.
- To allow new people in general that are interested and want to support the Elastic Project to gain a financial stake in it.

Below is a video created by chief developer (Evil-Knievel) of Elastic, to demonstrate the potential of Elastic. Mining Bitcoins is not a practical use case (the cost of mining Bitcoins would be far greater than the amount youâ€™d gain), but it is a great way to demonstrate the potential of Elastic. With Elastic you can design your own tasks/requirements using the Elastic programming language (Elastic PL). The Elastic programming language allows Elastic job authors to express complex algorithms to be solved for bounties, paid for with XEL, the Elastic crypto currency. The language is loosely based on the C programming language incorporating many of the basic operators and functions.
